# Research Reports and Applied Analysis

This directory contains a collection of **research reports and analytical documents**
produced during the development of the NLP pipeline.

The reports document the **thinking process behind system design**, focusing on
problem formulation, methodological choices, evaluation strategies, and practical
trade-offs encountered in real-world NLP applications.


The primary purpose of these reports is to complement the codebase by capturing:
- comparisons between alternative classical approaches,
- observations from experimentation and evaluation,
- constraints arising from enterprise and production settings.


---

## Scope

The reports may include:
- task definitions and framing of NLP problems,
- feature engineering considerations,
- model selection rationales,
- evaluation criteria and error analysis,
- reflections on scalability, maintainability, and deployment constraints.

They are intended to be read as **contextual documentation**, offering insight into
how and why specific solutions were chosen at the time.

## Relation to the Codebase

While the source code illustrates *how* the pipeline is implemented, the reports aim
to explain *why* certain design and modeling decisions were made.

Together, the code and the reports provide a more complete picture of the system as a
whole, combining implementation details with analytical and methodological context.

## Note

The documents in this directory are preserved in their original form and reflect the
state of NLP practices and considerations at the time they were written.

They are provided for **reference and educational purposes**, rather than as
up-to-date methodological guidance.
